# TemporalMotif-CTDG
## Abstract  
This project presents a method for modeling temporal networks using Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) with temporal motifs. Our approach captures the temporal evolution of interactions while preserving the underlying structural patterns. The method enhances predictive capabilities and enables better understanding of real-world dynamic networks.

## Method Overview  
Below is **Figure 3**, which illustrates the overall workflow of our method:
