# TemporalMotif-CTDG
## Abstract  
TemporalMotif-CTDG is a framework for analyzing temporal graph structures using motif-based methods. The project focuses on capturing dynamic graph patterns and leveraging them for downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. By integrating motif-based features into a continuous-time dynamic graph (CTDG) framework, we enhance the ability to model evolving relationships within graph-structured data.
