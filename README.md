# TemporalMotif-CTDG
## Abstract  
TemporalMotif-CTDG is a framework for analyzing temporal graph structures using motif-based methods. The project focuses on capturing dynamic graph patterns and leveraging them for downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. By integrating motif-based features into a continuous-time dynamic graph (CTDG) framework, we enhance the ability to model evolving relationships within graph-structured data.
## Method Overview  
Below is **Figure 1**, which illustrates the overall workflow of our method:

This figure illustrates the pipeline for extracting temporal motifs and incorporating them into the dynamic graph representation.

## Task Performed
We applied our framework to various temporal graph learning tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and parametric sensitivity analysis. The workflow for these tasks is shown in **Figure 2**:
